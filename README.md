# Project Overview 
My solution for this test allows the user to add new questions to the survey and save all questions when the 'Add new question' button is clicked.
I used a nested form to display the initial survey information and allow the user to see questions already saved and add new questions by using a dynamic form control
creation using a FormArray. 

This function is very important when creating surveys for a research platform as it is important to make the process as easy and pain free for the user as possible.
Replacing the use of Microsoft Word in the survey creation process will make the task much quicker and enjoyable for the user.
